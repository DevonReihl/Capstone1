This is my first capstone react client, 
In a user can browse at a photo/video gallery as well as learn more about GISH.
Members can update their info and new members can be added. 
Members can delete their person list items and add new items to their list.

For this Capstone I used React, CSS, Node, Express, and PostgreSQL (as well as FsLightbox)
